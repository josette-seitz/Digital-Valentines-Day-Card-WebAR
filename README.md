# Digital-Valentines-Day-Card-WebAR
Used Zappar AR (WebAR) Unity SDK to create a digital Valentine's Day Card.

There are 2 versions, Generic version and Michael version. Generic version is a template where user can switch out Audio, Images, etc.. for a more customized greeting card. Michael version is the sample customized version I made for my partner for Valentine's Day. I preferably like to gift experiences instead of materialistic items so I thought creating a fun WebAR Greeting Card application would be perfect.
